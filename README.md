# DATA115 Personal Dataset Project

## Motivation

I am a Pre-Nursing student, hoping to get into nursing school to become a future nurse. One of the many things I am passionate about is epideminology and public health. Because of my interest in these ares of health care. I decided to do my personal dataset profect on the current pandemic of COVID-19. COVID-19 has drastically changed all of our lives in the past year, and I think it is important to show that just because the United States has been dealing with this virus for so long, that doesn't mean it is over. COVID-19 is just as prevelant in Washington as it was a year ago. Due to my interest in these feilds COVID-19 data would be the most interesting to me. 

## Data source 

https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view 

## Processing 

I went to the Center of Disease Control website, on their COVID-19 data tracker page. I then went to search by county in Washington state. I noted several counties including Spokane county, Whitman county, Yakima county, King county, and Grant county. I took note of their weekly cases and there weekly percentage change. I then used excel to make visulaizations of the data that I used. I made two different bar graphs. One of the bar graphs shows the weekly cases for each county in Washington state. Using this visulization gave a better sence in where each county was at. The other bar graph that I created is showing the weekly percentage change in each county. This was used to better visualize how each county is changing and how some counties are doing worse than others in COVID-19 cases. 


## Visuals

This visual shows the amount of cases for the week of March 28th, 2021 for these five counties in Washington State.

This next visual shows the percent change of each each for the five counties. Whitman county as shown above has had a signifigant increase of COVID-19 cases for each week. 

## Analysis 

According to the visuals from above, COVID-19 cases in Washington state have not necessarily slowed down in the past year. Yakima county has actually seen the most improvement of handling this pandemic with a negative 40.77% decrease in weekly changes. Unlike, Whitman county which as seen a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases with a 852% weekly change. Knowing that the population differences is important. Besides Washington State University students Whitman county doesn't have that large of a population. But when this data was taken, most students are in Pullman WA, and this explains that crazy high percentage. Meanwhile other large counties including King and Spokane there hasn't been that large of an increase of COVID-19 cases, which is a good thing. Overall, with the surge of social distancing and mask wearing, and the vaccine rollout COVID-19 numbers can be lower and society can finally get past this pandemic.
