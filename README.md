# DATA115 Personal Dataset Project

## Motivation

I am a Pre-Nursing student, hoping to get into nursing school to become a future nurse. One of the many things I am passionate about is epideminology and public health. Because of my interest in these ares of health care. I decided to do my personal dataset profect on the current pandemic of COVID-19. COVID-19 has drastically changed all of our lives in the past year, and I think it is important to show that just because the United States has been dealing with this virus for so long, that doesn't mean it is over. COVID-19 is just as prevelant in Washington as it was a year ago. Due to my interest in these feilds COVID-19 data would be the most interesting to me.
